### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

I faced many challenges when developing this code. First of all, was starting late the project. Second thing was the usage of too much if-statements and not having on mind that the usage of elseif. This code is going to run many types of blood pressure readings divided in many groups (normal, elevated, stage 1 hypertension, stage 2 and hypertensive crisis). In order to not include several reduntant checks, I managed to stick together the conditions and stored them in short evaluations from high ranges to lower. I learnes how to develop codes together by the " (()) " usage.
